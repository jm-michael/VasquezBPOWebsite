                        Whether you’re the acquiring party (buyer) or the party being acquired (seller), it’s always a good idea to have an in-depth understanding and assessment on all financial aspects 
                        of the business before closing the sale and purchase agreement deal. Some of the procedures we perform include a review of financial statements – current, historical, and forecasted; 
                        analysis on trends, variances, and abnormalities; investigation of special matters such as financial commitments, contingent liabilities, and related party transactions; and evaluation 
                        of post balance sheet events.
